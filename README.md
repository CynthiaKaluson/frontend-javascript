# Frontend JavaScript

This repository contains my practice projects and solutions for **Frontend JavaScript** as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

The repo will cover different areas of JavaScript, starting with **TypeScript**.  
Each task is placed in its own folder, and the code is organized to make it easy to follow.

## What this repo includes
- Basic JavaScript concepts
- TypeScript setup and configuration
- Working with interfaces and classes
- Using namespaces and modules
- Practicing CRUD functions
- Advanced typing in TypeScript
- Webpack setup for bundling

## How it works
- Each project is in its own folder (example: `0x04-TypeScript`).
- Inside each project, tasks are separated into smaller folders (`task_0`, `task_1`, etc.).
- Every task has its own code files and configuration.

## Goal
This repo is for learning and practicing **modern JavaScript and TypeScript** step by step.  
It will help me understand how to:
- Write clean and structured code.
- Build and bundle JavaScript/TypeScript projects.
- Apply concepts I learn in the ALX curriculum.
